#  How to Submit Patches for libndp  #
=======================================

Send changes to libndp as patches to libndp-list@redhat.com 
with copy to jiri@resnulli.us.

Avoid using attachments because usually it doesn't work.
In another words, inline the patch inside the e-mail's body.

The simplest workflow to send changes is using git. The following
steps will guide you to do the task.

1) Clone the source code on your local machine.
$ git clone https://github.com/jpirko/libndp.git

2) Create a local branch for you
$ cd libndp
$ git checkout -b testbranch

3) Do your changes
<<do some changes>>

4) Commit them to the repository
$ git commit -a -s

5) Optionally, you can verify how it looks like in the repo
$ git show

6) Extract the patch in a standard format into /tmp directory
$ git format-patch origin -o /tmp --subject-prefix "patch libndp"

7) Use git send-email to send the patch*.
$ git send-email /tmp/0001-somepatch.patch \
  --to=libndp-list@redhat.com --cc=jiri@resnulli.us

And you are done :)

* You may need to configure smtp in order to send emails, so please
  check the "Example" section in the reference [3] below as a start.
